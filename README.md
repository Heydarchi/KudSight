 **This app is experimental and has not fully tested !**
</br>

**KudSight** is a Python-based static analysis tool that helps visualize **class relationships** in source code across several programming languages.

It supports extracting inheritance, implementation, and composition relations, and can render UML-style diagrams in browser..


## Features

- Language Support: Java, C++, C#, Kotlin
- Class relationship extraction: inheritance, implementation, dependencies
- Web-based UI and CLI
- Dockerized for cross-platform use


## Supported Languages

- Java (primary support)
- C++ (partial support)
- C# (partial support)
- Kotlin (experimental)

> Java, C++ and C# support is most stable. Other languages are work-in-progress. Contributions welcome!



**Note**
There are two ways to use this app. The first one is installing all the packages and running the app. And the second one is using docker.
I recommend using docker for sake of convenience and avoiding any conflict in installing the packages. So if you want to use docker you can jump to that section.

## Setting up manually
### Installation

> **Quick Start:** Run the setup script:
```bash
./setup.sh
```

#### Manual Setup

1. **Clone the repo with submodules**:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Heydarchi/KudSight.git
cd KudSight
```

2. **Install Python and dependencies**:

```bash
sudo apt install python3 python-is-python3 python3-venv default-jre graphviz -y
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


### Usage

#### Web Server (Recommended)

```bash
python app.py
```

Then open in your browser:

```
http://127.0.0.1:5000/
```

#### Command Line

```bash
python FileAnalyzer.py test/test_files/java
```

Results are saved to:

```
app/static/out/
```

## Docker


### Pull the Docker Image from DockerHub and Run

I have provide a docker image including the latest version of the application that you can easily pull and run it without setting up anything on you PC.

*Notes:*
- Create an out folder in the directory you want to run the docker to store the analysis result. (Mandatory)
- You can mount other folder, drivers and disks if you like. But the first part "$PWD/out:/app/static/out" should be kept.

Pull the image:
```bash
docker pull mhheydarchi/kudsight:latest
```

Run it:
```bash
docker run -it --rm --network host -v "$PWD/out:/app/static/out" -v "$HOME:/home/$USER" -v "/media:/media" -p 5000:5000  mhheydarchi/kudsight:latest
```

Now visit: [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

### Build the Docker Image locally and Run it

if you're interested to build the docker image locally and use it you can follow these steps:

### Build the Docker Image

```bash
docker build -t kudsight .
```

#### Run KudSight in Docker

> Create an out folder in the directory you want to run the docker to store the analysis result. (Mandatory)

```


Now visit: [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)
