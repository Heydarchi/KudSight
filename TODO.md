## TODO:
- [ ] Separate the variables  of Class & Method
- [ ] Detect the cascade classes
- [ ] Make a list of primitive variable types
- [ ] Put the project architecture diagram
- [ ] CSharp is semi tested 
- [ ] Need to have recursive analysis 


## UI Ideas:

1.  **Interactive Graph Controls:** Implement zooming, panning, and node dragging for the graph visualization.
2.  **Filtering and Search:** Add input fields or dropdowns to filter the displayed nodes and links by package/namespace, class name, or relationship type.
3.  **Node/Link Highlighting:** Highlight connected nodes and links when hovering over or selecting a specific node.
4.  **Details Panel:** Display detailed information (attributes, methods, source code snippet) about a selected class node in a separate panel.
5.  **Layout Algorithms:** Provide options to switch between different graph layout algorithms (e.g., force-directed, hierarchical).
6.  **Analysis Progress:** Show a visual indicator (e.g., progress bar) while the backend is analyzing the source code.
7.  **Export Functionality:** Add buttons to export the current graph view as an image (SVG/PNG) or the underlying data as JSON.
